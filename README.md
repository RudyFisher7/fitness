# Fitness

A project I use for refreshing myself in SQL and Python.

## Getting started
1. Install Python with pip.
2. At the root of this project, run "pip install -r python/requirements.txt".
3. Download the sqlite shared libraries and commandline tools to your machine and put them somewhere on disc (e.g. C:\sqlite).
4. Add the folder with the sqlite libraries and tools to your system's "PATH".
5. (Optional) Install the DB Browser for SQLite.

## Notes
- All dates and times are stored in UTC.
- I'm trying to use the datatypes in the SQL database that are the most universally supported across systems. A note is given to indicate any specific usage (e.g., TEXT used as a DATETIME).
